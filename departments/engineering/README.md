# Engineering Department

## Overview

The Engineering Department at Tier 4 AI is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of our AI products and services. We build scalable, reliable, and ethical AI systems that solve real-world problems for our clients.

## Team Structure

- **AI Research Team** - Focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art in AI technologies
- **ML Engineering Team** - Builds and optimizes machine learning models for production
- **Data Engineering Team** - Manages data pipelines and infrastructure
- **Platform Engineering Team** - Develops and maintains our core AI platform
- **DevOps Team** - Ensures reliable deployment and operation of our systems
- **QA Team** - Tests and validates our AI systems for reliability and fairness

## Development Process

Our engineering team follows an agile development methodology with two-week sprints. We use a combination of Scrum and Kanban practices to ensure efficient delivery while maintaining flexibility.

### Sprint Cycle

1. **Sprint Planning** - Prioritize tasks and estimate effort
2. **Daily Standups** - Brief team check-ins to discuss progress and blockers
3. **Sprint Review** - Demo completed work and gather feedback
4. **Sprint Retrospective** - Reflect on the sprint and identify improvements

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Go
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Kafka, Airflow
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS/GCP
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- All code must follow our style guides
- Code reviews are required for all changes
- Unit tests are required for all new features
- Documentation is required for all APIs

### AI Ethics Guidelines

- All AI systems must be tested for bias
- Explainability features must be implemented where possible
- Privacy considerations must be addressed in the design phase
- Regular ethical reviews are conducted for all AI systems

## Project Management

We use GitHub for code management and issue tracking. All projects should have:

- A clear README with setup instructions
- Documented API endpoints
- Comprehensive test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Onboarding Resources

- [Development Environment Setup Guide](./onboarding/dev-environment.md)
