# Contributing to Tier 4 Intelligence Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Tier 4 Intelligence documentation repository. This guide outlines the process for making contributions to ensure consistency and quality across our documentation.

## Getting Started

### Repository Structure

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the repository structure:

- `/company` - Company overview, mission, vision, and values
- `/departments` - Department-specific information and processes
- `/products` - Product documentation and roadmaps
- `/policies` - Company-wide policies and procedures
- `/resources` - Shared resources and templates
- `/ai-ethics` - AI ethics guidelines and principles

### Access and Permissions

- All team members have read access to the repository
- Department leads and designated contributors have write access to their respective sections
- Repository administrators have full access to all sections

## Contribution Process

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes. Never commit directly to the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Branch naming convention:
- For new content: `add/section-name`
- For updates: `update/section-name`
- For fixes: `fix/section-name`

### 2. Make Your Changes

When creating or updating documentation:

- Follow the established formatting and style guidelines
- Use clear, concise language
- Include relevant examples and visuals when appropriate
- Ensure accuracy and completeness of information
- Update any related documentation that may be affected by your changes

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add sales process documentation"
```

Good commit messages:
- Start with a verb (Add, Update, Fix, Remove, etc.)
- Clearly describe what was changed
- Reference issue numbers if applicable

### 4. Create a Pull Request

When your changes are ready for review:

1. Push your branch to the repository
2. Create a pull request (PR) through the GitHub interface
3. Fill out the PR template with details about your changes
4. Assign relevant reviewers based on the content area

### 5. Review Process

All contributions go through a review process:

- Department-specific content is reviewed by department leads
- Company-wide content is reviewed by leadership team members
- Technical content may require review from the engineering team
- All content should be reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and alignment with company standards

### 6. Address Feedback

If changes are requested during the review:

1. Make the requested changes in your branch
2. Commit and push the updates
3. Respond to the review comments indicating the changes made

### 7. Merge

Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch by a repository administrator.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Formatting

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Follow consistent heading hierarchy (# for main title, ## for sections, etc.)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Include code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting when relevant

### Content Structure

- Begin each document with a clear title and brief overview
- Organize content logically with descriptive headings
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- End with relevant contact information or next steps

### Style Guidelines

- Use active voice and present tense
- Be concise and direct
- Avoid jargon unless necessary for the target audience
- Define acronyms on first use
- Use consistent terminology throughout

### File Naming

- Use lowercase for file names
- Separate words with hyphens (e.g., `sales-process.md`)
- Choose descriptive, concise names
- Include file extension (typically `.md`)

## Special Considerations

### Sensitive Information

- Never include sensitive information such as:
  - Customer names without permission
  - Proprietary technical details
  - Financial data
  - Personal information
  - Authentication credentials

### External References

- When linking to external resources, ensure they are:
  - Reliable and reputable sources
  - Likely to remain available long-term
  - Appropriate for sharing with all team members

### Images and Media

- Store images in an `/assets` folder within the relevant section
- Use descriptive file names for images
